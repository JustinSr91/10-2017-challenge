# 10-2017-challenge

Requirements:

1. Setup a github repo and send the url of the repo before you start.
2. Use React/Redux/Webpack - other tools are up to you
3. Interact with google maps API directly rather than using a 3rd party library

# Objective

Use the Google Maps JavaScript API to create an app which will let you drop a pin on a few locations, click a button, and then suggest the most efficient (by time) way to visit all these places. Your application should have a view with a history of all these times/routes. If you select a route in the history it should show the the route/time on the map.

# Keys

• Quality and tidiness of my code
• Unit tests
• How I'm using git
• What tools and 3rd party libraries I end up using

# Checklist
[] Create boilerplate
